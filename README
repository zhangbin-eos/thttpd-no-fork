             thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server
                    version 2.29 of 23May2018

thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.

Small: See the size comparison chart at
http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/notes.html#sizes.  It also has a
very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about
memory allocation.

Portable: It compiles cleanly on FreeBSD 2.x/3.x, SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x,
BSD/OS 2.x, Linux 1.2.x, OSF/1 (on a 64-bit Alpha), and no doubt many others.

Fast: In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers
(Apache, NCSA, Netscape).  Under extreme load it's much faster.

Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine
against attacks and breakins from other sites.

It also has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling) that
no other server currently has.

See the manual entry for more details.  See the INSTALL file for
configuration and installation instructions.  Check the web page

在调用cgi部分使用了很多的内存申请,但是没有释放,如果使用的是fork的方式,则不会产
生什么问题,但是如果使用其他的方式,会造成很多的内存泄露,并导致程序段错误.

配置过程将产生一个配置文件在objs中
运行时,确保www文件和运行权限是可访问的.路径权限不正确时,程序运行异常
